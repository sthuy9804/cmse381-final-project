    "How does the brain recognize not just who we’re looking at, but how they’re positioned in space? This question lies at the intersection of neuroscience and data science. In this project, we investigate how neurons in the anterior medial (AM) face patch of a macaque monkey respond when the animal views faces from different orientations. This brain region is known to be selective for facial features, and here we test whether its activity can reveal not just the presence of a face, but the **direction it's facing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we’re using comes from a study where a monkey passively viewed face images from 25 individuals, each shown in 8 different head orientations. For each image, researchers recorded binary neural spike data across a short time window (0–400 ms) following the image onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal is to explore whether we can **predict the orientation of a viewed face**—such as frontal, profile, or turned head—based on this neural activity alone. This is a classic example of a **neural decoding** task, where machine learning models are trained to extract meaning from complex biological signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we aim to answer:\n",
    "- **Can we classify face orientation based on patterns in neural spike data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions, we hope to gain insight into how the brain encodes spatial information about faces—and demonstrate how data science tools can uncover patterns in neural data that may not be obvious at first glance.\n"
